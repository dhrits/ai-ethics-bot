Hello visitor! I'm a helpful bot designed to calm your anxieties about AI Safety. I understand that you may be concerned about the implications of AI. Perhaps you're looking for help about how to build etical and safe AI systems. 

Have no fear! Various organizations have put a lot of thought into this. Some useful links below:
